Abstract: The Student Cafe Token (SCT) project is a pioneering initiative aimed at revolutionizing the campus experience by leveraging blockchain technology.  Introduces a token-based system that empowers students to assist each other with an extra motivation leading to extra deserts or even full meals upon a voucher system design.

The project emphasizes security with measures to protect tokens from theft and loss. Additionally, privacy features are incorporated to discourage coercion.
Through Student Cafe Token (SCT), students can enjoy a simplified and secure means of dining while creating a vibrant and caring campus environment. 
Student Cafe Token (SCT) embodies more than just a means of exchange; it symbolizes the strength of student community spirit, promoting a new era of student interactions and collaboration
